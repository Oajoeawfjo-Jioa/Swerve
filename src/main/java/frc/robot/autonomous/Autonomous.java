 * Will run all comands in order within it's parentheses
 * Note: If a comand does not have a isFinshed statment the code will be stuck
 * on that command forever
 *
 * ParallelCommandGroup:
 * Will run commands in parallel if they use diffrent SubSystems
 * Note: Both commands will have to finish to move on
 *
 * ParallelRaceGoup:
 * Will run commands in parallel if they use diffrent SubSystems
 * Note: As soon as one command runs it's isfinished method runs then both
 * commands will end
 *
 * ParallelDeadlineGroup
 * Will run commands in parallel if they use diffrent SubSystems
 * Note: Only the first command will finish the group
